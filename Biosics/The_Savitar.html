<b>Prop: You can never fully understand the bios of others. </b><br>
<b>Proof:</b> A's bio is logically lopsided, A's log is ideally not lopsided, B's bio is lopsided.<br>
A cannot use bio to understand B's bio because everyone's windings are different. <br>
A cannot use log to understand B's bio because log itself is not lopsided, and to try to imitate others' winding, a log cannot recall (abstract/particular) something bio has not experienced and learned as the others did to feel the proper amount of lopsidedness. <br>
The distribution of lopsidedness are paramount to a person's making-a-decisions (hence way of life).<br>
<b>E.g.:</b> Loan is usually not a pain to those who have not had one or who are just starting to get one, with the reasoning: it's just a monthly payment and you can just deduct it when your mentally checking your account.<br>
Loan is a pain to think about to those who have had a long term one(s). Its logically not a problem, but everyone wishes to get it over with soon.<br>
<b>Conc:</b> Your judgement on other's behavior will never be accurate.<br>
