<b>Prop: You can never fully understand the bios of others. </b><br>
<b>Proof:</b> A's bio is logically lopsided, A's log is ideally not lopsided, B's bio is lopsided.<br>
A cannot use bio to understand B's bio because everyone's windings are different. <br>
A cannot use log to understand B's bio because log itself is not lopsided, and to try to imitate others' winding, a log cannot recall (abstract/particular) something bio has not experienced and learned as the others did to feel the proper amount of lopsidedness. <br>
The distribution of lopsidedness are paramount to a person's making-a-decisions (hence way of life).<br>
<b>E.g.:</b> Loan is usually not a pain to those who have not had one or who are just starting to get one, with the reasoning: it's just a monthly payment and you can just deduct it when your mentally checking your account.<br>
Loan is a pain to think about to those who have had a long term one(s). Its logically not a problem, but everyone wishes to get it over with soon.<br>
<b style="color:purple">Conc: Your judgement (log or bio) on other's behavior will never be accurate.</b><br>

<br>

<b>Prop: Your drive to correct others is to serve your own bio purpose.</b><br>
<b>Proof:</b> A drive is a feeling, a feeling stems from your bio, a bio's logic is distorted towards your survival/breeding and not programed towards their own good. <br>
<b>E.g.:</b> you wanted Jim to be with Meiqi b/c the log purpose is to make him happy. However, he wouldn't be if with her and your preference stemmed from your bio of not wanting to feel the "misery" of your good friend whom you owe much to.<br>
<b style="color:purple">Conc: The urge to interfere with other's life when unasked is not because they need it but because you want it.</b><br> 

<br>

<b>Prop:</b> If the modern world is considered better than the primitive times (when humans had the same brain structure as today), then bio plays an integral role as log does.<br>
<b>Proof:</b> Bio provides a safe environment for log;<br>
Bio is what spurred the world to advance (e.g., the lazy and the pain-avioding mechanisms);<br>
Bio is what made people different, and the world diverse (in terms of passions, choices, etc.)<br>
Log can never achieve those without bio.<br>
<b>Conc:</b> Bio gives log its purposes and a world of possibilities.<br>
<b>Conc:</b> If you dislike bio for getting in the way of log's purpose, know that it is what gives log its purpose in the first place (the parent of log). <br>
<b style="color:purple">Conc:Do not hate bio.</b><br>
