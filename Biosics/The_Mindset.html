<h3>
The Mindset</h3>
A stanford psychologist who spent his life studying human influence.
◦ <b>Your brain is wired to say "yes" to someone who says "no" to you</b><br>
> When you want someone to say "yes" to you, it puts them in the position of power. You want something from them, and they know it. They think that they are better than you, and will often treat you poorly, or reject you.<br>
<br>
◦ <b> Humans are wired to want the things that we cannot have.</b><br>
◦ <b> the secret to getting someone to say "yes" to you is to challenge them, and sometimes, to outright say no to them.</b><br>
◦ A reference: a sales person use evolutionary flaws to quickly establish his superiority and make the prospect lusty with desire.
◦ Simple ways to challenge women: <br>
E.g. >one of the first questions that women ask is "what do you do?" <br>
>>The low-power man: I do this (awesome) job. (trying to impress) <br>
>> The high-power man: oh, just the most important job in the world. Then a smile. <br>
>>> She'll laugh and ask "Really? What is it?" <br>
>>> Now she's the cat and keep her playing with the string.
>>>>"ok, you get two guesses and I'll give you a hint: I'm not the President of Nigeria"
>>>> so it keeps her chasing after that string... it shows her you're superior.<br>
>>>> ......<br>
>>>>> At night, only you two. "Listen, I think you're really cool, but I want you to know that I don't sleep with women right away, ok?" <br>
>>>>> It's crazy how these words will melt her defense. Other men just just wanna have sex right away, and she KNOWS and has to fend them off. But your different. You've just said "no" to sex with her that night, so you're now a "challenge" for her to seduce. And the best part of all is that women love this.<br>
$ it's a HUGE turnoff when a guy volunteers information too easily. Think of a cat chasing a string; as soon as the cat gets the string it gets bored.<br>
$$ what you do DOESN'T matter (see: 1> a "bad"job reflects the quality of your attraction; a "good" job is, you know, good for you' 2> you should be proud of whatever you do), what matters is that you challenge her. <br>

<br>
when the TIME IS RIGHT, and when <b> a moment of admiration can spike in their mind </b> <br>
Say as little words as possible!!! <br>
E.g. <br>
B: are you not gonna go to the class?<br>
A (an insecure version of you): haha, no, I actually never listen to a class since...; not because "oh I'm too cool for this" but because I have strong ADHD, I .... <br>
B (a secure version): no I'm not. (certain, with or without a smile).<br>

<br>
words are not contributing real much, it's all about aura <br>
Think of 孟老大，PQM's book-reading moment, the WV watress, and Henry Kendrick.
