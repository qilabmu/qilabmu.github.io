<h3>
Practicals - Dialogue</h3>
◦ <b>When she devalues herself in a way you don't really approve of: </b><br>
◦◦  follow the way she criticise herself and exaggerate it. (a playful means)<br>
◦◦◦  then she's gonna get upset b/c she's not really here to confirm that her self-criticism is sound but the other way around.<br>
> Herbio: something triggered her insecurity and herbio's looking for an approval from you.<br>
>> Your Move: being playful with her is already telling herbio that she is indeed loved not in a conditional way, while not following what herbio desires keeps your own integrity and reinforce the boundries between her problems and yours.<br>
E.g.:<br> 
A: 羡慕啊，(Jim)都在湾区找到工作了[Cry]<br>
A: 我还在上学<br>
B: 哦<br>
B: um<br>
B: 对啊<br>
B: 你怎么还在上学<br>
B: 都25了还没踏出学校门(she's only 22)<br>
B: 诶<br>
A: 你**才25[Smile]<br>
A: [a meme that displays anger]<br>
A: [the same meme]

<br>
<br>
◦<b> In a playful interaction: when she denies a fact that might put her in disadvantage</b><br>
◦◦ agree with what she denies even though you both know that she's denying. Then use sarcasm to criticize yourself for thinking that there exist someone who'd do what she denied and then moralize the deed in an obviously exaggerated way.<br>
E.g.:<br> 
B: Did you just take a picture of me? (she did)<br>
A: No, I was, um, just checking the message at a weird angle.<br>
B: Right right, of course you were. It's my fault that I believed that there exsits such a horrible person who'd sneakly take a photo of someone and then lie about it. There's just no way such an aweful human being can exist, no way.<br>

◦ when she <b>keeps complaining about stuff</b><br>
◦◦ Think of something you can relate, and tell her "I can't 100% relate, but I got something and I'm gonna tell you soon how it ended up" <br>
<b style="color:orange"> >your showing that your not a self-entitled asshole who knows everything. </b> <br>
◦◦ Alternatively, tell a general truth, and say "I'm pretty sure you know this, but a lot of times, if people don't get enough real-life experience of what they know, they need to be reminded." <br>
◦◦◦ How you dealt with the situation must comes from a different point of view than hers (which caused her complaining), and how your story ended up well. End with "I hope it helped at least a little bit"<br>
<b style="color:orange"> >> you showed your real values (of dealing with adverse situations)</b><br>
◦◦◦◦ Say emotions are infectious, and that "I was originally in a great mood but your negative stuff just swoop it away, you gotta be responsible for this!" you gotta rewire my brain to make me happier<br>
<b>Direction 1: you wanna take advantage of her</b><br>
◦◦◦◦ Alternatively, tell a joke saying stuff like "ok I've spent this long talking to you, and I should remind you my that my consulting fee is charged by minutes" so it's time you pay "any made-up big number" bucks. <br>
<b style="color:orange"> >>> Now that she felt better and more connected to you, remind herbio that she's "owing you" cuz you cost yourself something to help her vonluntarily (putting her into the Reciprocity)</b><br>
◦◦◦◦◦ (obviously she can't do any of those requests) Fine (speak like you are disappointed) , I can accept alternative repayment methods, , what do you think you can offer?  <br>
◦◦◦◦◦◦ Whatever she says, as long as it's not a date or a kiss or the like, say "NO, I don't want that"; now say "just give me a kiss (when your super sure that she likes you" or "I been thinking of [an activity], you should join us", followed by a pinky swear.
<b style="color:orange"> >>>> The Reciprocation makes her more likely to say "yes" and the pinky swear reinforced the Consistency to make her more likely to join your activity.</b><br>
<b>Direction 2: your don't wanna take advantage of her</b><br>
◦◦◦◦◦ "Now say something that's happy and happened to you"
