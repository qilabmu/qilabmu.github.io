<h3>
Reason for not Interfering</h3>
◦ You do sth for a purpose; <br>
If the thing doesn’t lead to the purpose (e.g., when bio drives (and there’s a preference) see A01 hypothesis),
Then why doing it? (A neutral question).<br>
◦ Test if applicable:<br>
See if there's a preferred outcome<br>
◦ Feasibility of the test:<br>
Dispensary Triggering: possible to know your preference by imagining and feeling it<br>
◦ E.g. you wanted Jim to be with Meiqi b/c the log purpose is to make him happy. However, he wouldn’t be if with her and your preference stemmed from your bio of not wanting to feel the "misery" of your good friend whom you owe much.<br>
