<b>Should and Shouldn't</b><br>
<b>Def:</b><br>
You do sth for a purpose; <br>
If the thing doesn't lead to the purpose (e.g., when bio drives (and thereâ€™s a preference) see A01 hypothesis),
Then why doing it? (A neutral question).<br>
Test if applicable:<br>

<br>

<b>Do and Don't</b><br>
If the bio's reason for intention known to log and its real intention agrees, then do it. If those neither agree or contradict, then log be the judge. If there is a contradiction, then do not do it.<br>
E.g.: 
1) Bio's urge for soccer is for the love of it, log thinks that bio is driven by the propensity to feeling cool and healthy, log approves, hence soccer is do-able.<br>
2) The shallow reason of Bio's urge to hook Jim up with Meiqi is to make Jim happier, but log reasoned that the urge is purely selfish and would not make him happy, hence it is not do-able.<br>
<br>

<b>The Bio Probe</b><br>
<b>Def:</b> Do loggly a set of hypos (by imagining) and see if there's a preferred outcome.<br>
<b>Prop:</b> Bio probes can help log know the wiring structure upon the reception of information.<br>
<b>Proof:</b> Any information set, hypos, reals, hallucinations, etc., can dispensarily trigger bio's auto-feeling arousals. Bio's wiring usually has a preferred outcome. Log can do hypos and if it hypos over a set of possible outcomes, then it can know the one that generate the best feeling, which is bio's preference.<br>
