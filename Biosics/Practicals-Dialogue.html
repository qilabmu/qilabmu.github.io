<h3>
Practicals - Dialogue</h3>
◦ <b>When she devalues herself in a way you don't really approve of: </b><br>
◦◦  follow the way she criticise herself and exaggerate it. (a playful means)<br>
◦◦◦  then she's gonna get upset b/c she's not really here to confirm that her self-criticism is sound but the other way around.<br>
> Herbio: something triggered her insecurity and herbio's looking for an approval from you.<br>
>> Your Move: being playful with her is already telling herbio that she is indeed loved not in a conditional way, while not following what herbio desires keeps your own integrity and reinforce the boundries between her problems and yours.<br>
E.g.:<br> 
A: 羡慕啊，(Jim)都在湾区找到工作了[Cry]<br>
A: 我还在上学<br>
B: 哦<br>
B: um<br>
B: 对啊<br>
B: 你怎么还在上学<br>
B: 都25了还没踏出学校门(she's only 22)<br>
B: 诶<br>
A: 你**才25[Smile]<br>
A: [a meme that displays anger]<br>
A: [the same meme]

◦<b> In a playful interaction: when she denies a fact that might put her in disadvantage</b><br>
◦◦ agree with what she denies even though you both know that she's denying. Then use sarcasm to criticize yourself for thinking that there exist someone who'd do what she denied and then moralize the deed in an obviously exaggerated way.<br>
E.g.:<br> 
B: Did you just take a picture of me? (she did)<br>
A: No, I was, um, just checking the message at a weird angle.<br>
B: Right right, of course you were. It's my fault that I believed that there exsits such a horrible person who'd sneakly take a photo of someone and then lie about it. There's just no way such an aweful human being can exist, no way.<br>
