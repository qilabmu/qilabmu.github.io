When you <b> want to invite her to a group activity</b><br>
◦ State what you are gonna do with your FRIENDS and that your gonna have fun (picture it to show the prospect is really enjoyable)<br>
◦◦ Pause for a while and ask them "why don't you come over too?'' and NO EXPLANATIONS as to why they should.<br>
> When you didn't invite her in the first place, she's gonna doubt if she's less loved, and she wouldn't expect that you would suddenly invite her.<br>
>> When you start inviting her by surprise, <br>
# Group: The amplitude <br>
<br>

When you <b> want her to do something (i> bonding ii> easy) </b><br>
◦ Use a gangster's tone and ORDER "you, do this (to ...)" / "why don't you ..."<br>
◦ NEVER ask with a begging tone and say things like "you wanna .... ?"<br>
E.g. 1> (the one you did well) <br>
B: come closer (looking at her with full certainty) <br>
E.g. 2> (what you should do instead but you blew) <br>
B: [Name], keep this to keep this memory of ours. (then put the paper on the desk and turn your head slightly away to pack your own stuff)<br>
# Group: The masculinity <br>

<br>
When you <b> wanna do something with her and wanna hint that you like her</b><br>
◦ Explain why she should do this (a reason that any civil person would be willing to do for you, like a small favor).<br>
◦◦ When she's digesting it, suddenly acknowledge that "Nah I just made that up" and that the real reason is that "I just want you to come", spoken with a certiain tone and nothing else.<br>
E.g. 1>  The Tian's "just wanted to come over and talk to you" method.<br>
# Group: The amplitude & The masculinity <br>

<br>
When she <b> wants to do so bad with you but you don't want to go but ok if you don't have anything to lose to keep her happy this way</b><br>
◦ Say you don't wanna go in a certain tone and let her react.<br>
◦◦ Say, you know what, I really wanna check out this place to see why it attracts you so much, will you please come with me? with an insincere tone to inform her that that ain't the reason.<br>
