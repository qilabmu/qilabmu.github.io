When you <b> are not confident about your look</b><br>
◦ Listen, Thomas, whatever triggered your inconfidence in your looks, think about this: <br>
When your looks were way worse, i.e., in high school, Du, who's such a beautiful girl, loved you like crazy and SAID to you that you are the most beautiful person in her eyes. <br>
And think about Pi, she's got virtually no traits of a beautiful woman and your friends know that, but remember the evening of 01/08/2017 when she walked in from the back door, you SAID to your friend "she's so beautiful" while the only thing she did differently was wearing a different jacket. Many people you know think she's beautiful, and this is coming from her confidence and traits in her personality that are attractive. <br>
<b>So, just know this: "Looks are interprated by the beholder's brain with your personality being its metric." </b> <br>

<br>
When you <b> don't feel confident or powerful when girls are gonna be around/already around</b><br>
◦ Watch clips of the behaviors of badass and confident men that attract women so much <br>
1> The "Scoundrel"<br>
2> Juan's "I like you"<br>

<br>
When you <b> aren't accepting enough/feel hatred </b><br>
1> Abaraham Lincoln: "Do I not destroy my enermies when I make them my friends?" <br>
2> When you fucked up on 04/22/2016, Hu, with whom you don't usually get along well with, held your hands for so long. Did he love you less for failure to achieve anything? He could have taken advantage of that moment and be like "now your taking your lesson" but he showed love.<br>
3> Go ahead and listen to "Rivers flow in you". Casey is better than you in all the possible areas while you are also so needy for him, and he still loves you like fuck.<br>
4> "There are bullet cases, just be careful". You were a dumb nobody and he called you up and patiently repeated what he wasn't even responsible to tell you. <br>
5> Check Qiaodan Li's clip. Look at her genuine smile. You didn't know her but she showed such a great atmosphere that displays a less-insecure and attractive persona. As you checked back, she's indeed successful.<br>
6> Think of your first 483 test, when your miscalculation led to a fatally wrong final answer, Dr. Mirza followed your wrong calculations and saw that you knew how to approach the problem and did not take a single point off, and he didn't even mention it. He showed love and trust with no intention for anything in return. <br>
7> Think of KFJ. He wished you to travel to NYC knowing that your as poor as fudge and wanted to pay everything for you even tho he's not got much money. He was so elated when he hears that you got an offer and told you he couldn't really be happy for those months because you didn't get one. <br>

<br>
when you <b> are afriad of the potential threat of other men or anything </b>
You wanna show that you ain't afraid of any challenges/threats. <br>
Jianqiao, 2017: “你喜欢她就去追啊” <br>
Alex: You want to be in a relationship with the kind of woman that EVERY guy wants.<br>
Challenges make you feel alive, remember? If you lose her, you know there's stuff to learn, to better yourself. If you win her, you can't really efficiently extract the truth.<br>
When you fear their presence and they don't do the same about you, you're already losing. <br>

<br>
when you <b> try to be cool </b><br>
Think of 08/23, you didn't show her anything cool in your life (future, past) and you were so connected and attracted to each other <br>
Think of 08/25, you said "hey I'm cooler" and the yosemite guy walked away from you. ESL showed much more genuine laughs with AX than with you. <br>
Think of 09/01, you tried to show you got friends to hang out and implied that your life is certainly more fun than hers without actually knowing if it's true, and she snubbed you <br>
Leqi & Jet definitely doesn't have cool stuff going on in his life, and yet you and so many girls are drawn to them, cuz they just be themselves. <br>
trying to appear cooler or trying to make them seem less cooler is NOTHING DIFFERENT from trying to show you got more (achievement) and make them feel what they got isn't good enough. <br>
