<h3>
Humor Theories</h3>
◦ People like, listen to, and trust more to those who make them laugh<br>
A study: one smart man and one averagely intelligent man but with a sense of humor talking to bunch of people. All thought the second was more intelligent.<br>
◦ When girls laugh, they release massive amount of dopamine’s in her brain, the feel good hormone. Interestingly, women tend to release more dopamine than men.<br>
◦ Expectational misdirection: doing this makes you look like you have great situational awareness and you have the ability to come up with a clever or comical observation. It also makes you look like you’re able to think on your feet which shows others you’re charming and you have the ability to win others affection and interest.<br>
◦ Self-enhancing humor: not only your embarrassment will lessen but it can also help you come off as fun to be with. People will laugh with you but not at you.<br>
◦ Being relaxed is contagious. You need to be relaxed or your audience will not feel relaxed enough to laugh.<br>
