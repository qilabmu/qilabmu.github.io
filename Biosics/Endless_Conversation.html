<b> Structure of a good conversation flow</b><br>
Topical: E.g., travel, food, TV shows<br>
Personal (preferences): I really like xxx taco.<br>
Interpersonal: Ok, we should totally make a taco together.<br>
Note: you should usually go back and forth between topical and personal.
<br>
<b> Topical </b>
In the early stages of conversation, what I (CH) typically do is typically to find a topic that we can both vibe on together (both interested).<br>
<br>
What are you doing in topical conversation: your getting more details, and your asking clarifying questions typically.<br>
Clear your mind, don't try to think of the "correct" thing to say, figure out what details are missing<br>
E.g.: A: I like Mexico <br>
B: where were you in Mexico.<br>
<br>
Your also sharing facts, personal experiences. <br>
Or, your being taught. CH: girls actually like teaching stuff (that they're interested in) <br>
> Trigger her good memories, and boom, you are hebbian-linked with her happiness.<br>

<br>
How do we make topical stuff fun? This is something that CH had been struggling with for a really long time. <br>
1> misdirection: you set her expectation to one direction and as she keeps going, and then all of a sudden, you drop her (bondingly).<br>
remember, your tonality can help a lot! use your tonality to misdirect her.<br>
<br>

<b> Personal</b><br>
To create rapport, you gotta be genuine. genuine/relavent is for rapport, is to bring you closer<br>
What do you like about the stuff, and what she likes about the stuff<br>
I like Domican republic better than Mexico cuz... <br>
She likes Mexico better ... <br>
<br>
your example:<br>
I absolutely love hoagies with jalapeno falvored chips on the side. And the hoagie must be dressed with sweet onion sauce. I've been meaning to replicate Subway's bread recipe, do you make breads on your own? (if they don't, what's your personal faviorite hoagie style) <br>

<br>
<b> Interpersonal </b><br>
"don't stay in the 'interpersonal' stage for too long".<br>
Ok you sold me, I like Mexico but the way you described Mexico I think I've gotta go check it out and I think you've gotta come with me cuz it sounds like you'd be a great tour guide.<br>
your example:<br>
We should totally make a sandwich together. You show me how to bake breads, and I'll show you the incredible sandwich I was talking about.

<br>
<b>Compliment</b><br>
The compliment is about you and her doing something together, and not just about her or descriptive like "you really make me wanna go there"
E.g., OMG you were just so cute and I feel like taking you home and eat you.<br>

<b> Genuity and disgenuity principle</b><br>
you wanna play with her like on a seesaw going up and down from genuine to disgenuous and she'll be like whow this guy's a nice guy -> this is so fun -> this guy is a nice guy -> ..... (nice in a non-pejorative way)<br>

<br>
To create emotional spikes, you gotta be disgenuine.<br>
A good flirtation: fake romance <br>
use your tone and words to describe something that's romantic and detailed first but obviously fake, and then you throw a hint about your relationship with her in this imagination. <br>
E.g. in a Karaoke bar <br>
A: [Her name], sit next to me (with your gang tone)<br>
B: just do it, and I'll explain why (keep your tone)<br>
A: you know those people are bad people, I just received a phone call from CIA and they told me they're gonna start hurting people <br>
A: but hey, don't worry, your safe, I'm here to protect you alright? If anyone asks, just say I'm your boyfriend, and then they'll stop hurting you.<br>

<br>
The genuine stuff is even more powerful when used right after disgenuious stuff. Because if the disgenuious stuff is funny and makes her laugh, it lowers her defenses and she's more open to hearing you about something really genuine.<br>
to go from disgenuious to genuine:<br>
reveal part of the truth (you both knew you were just kidding around so you didn't need to explain the whole thing) in a non-embarassing way and do something genuine that's bonding.<br>
E.g., ok what I just told were true, you DEFINITELY bought it! but let me just surprise you, this weren't true alright? Well, our glasses are almost empty why don't we get another drink, or I buy a drink for you.<br>
> this is not sexism, the way you worked yourself to get her the drink makes her feel she deserves a drink.<br>

<br>
A good flirtation: transition (Juan's stuff)<br>
B: God it's so cold outside;<br>
A: I know, it's so cold, I hate this city, I hate the atmosphere, (certain, raise your heads up) I wanna go on a vacation, where should we go.,<br>

<br>
when you said/did something that might be embrassing.<br>
(did I just) laugh at yourself first like CH.<br>

<br>
CH: girls like to be called feisty and/or bratty cuz they like to argue they like to have fun with it.<br>
